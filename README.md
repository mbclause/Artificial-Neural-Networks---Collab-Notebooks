# Deep Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains a series of deep learning and machine learning projects completed for coursework at California State University, Fullerton. The notebooks demonstrate practical implementations of neural network models for various classification tasks, ranging from sentiment analysis to handwritten digit and character recognition.

# 1. CPSC_585_Project_2_Group_10.ipynb

This project explores sentiment and difficulty prediction from student comments using deep learning techniques. The notebook:

  * Preprocesses natural language text data using tokenization and padding.

  * Uses GloVe embeddings for input representation.

  * Trains several neural network architectures (GRU, LSTM) using Keras to predict:

      * Star ratings

      * Difficulty levels

  * Evaluates models using training/validation accuracy and loss curves.

# 2. Group_7_Project_1.ipynb

A group project for the Artificial Neural Networks course, Section 01, authored by Behzad Hosseini, Raffay Ahmed, Nick Bidler, Michael Clausen, Kristopher Curry, and Janvier Uwase.

The notebook:

  * Trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten letters.

  * Explores transfer learning approaches.

  * Uses Keras and TensorFlow for model development.

  * Includes reproducibility features with shared Drive-based datasets and model saving.

# 3. Michael_Clausen_Intro_Project.ipynb

This introductory project demonstrates digit recognition using a feed-forward neural network:

  * Uses an 8x8 image dataset of handwritten digits.

  * Builds a simple four-layer neural network using ReLU activations and softmax output.

  * Trains and evaluates using train/test splits and categorical cross-entropy loss.

# 4. Research Paper
An original research paper detailing recent advances in applying deep learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
